\item Sophie rolls a fair die 12 times.

The random variable $X$ represents the number of times the die lands on a six.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(\alph*)}]
  \item Using a suitable distribution for $X$, find\\[5pt]
  \quad (i) $P(X=4)$\\[2pt]
  \quad (ii) $P(X\le 4)$ \marks{3}

\noindent Sophie repeats this experiment each day for 80 days and records the number of days when $X=4$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(\alph*)},resume]
  \item Find the probability that there were at least 18 days when $X=4$. \marks{3}\medskip
  % \marginpar will work even though the next item (c) has a long line
  \item Find an estimate for the total number of sixes that Sophie will roll during these 80 days. \marks{1} \medskip
  % \marginpar will work even though this item (d) has a long line
  \item Use a normal approximation to estimate the probability that Sophie rolls a total of more than 175 sixes during these 80 days. \marks{4}

\item The proportion of left-handed adults in a country is $12\%$.
Maya believes that the proportion of left-handed adults under the age of $30$ in this country is different from $12\%$.
She takes a random sample of $50$ adults under the age of $30$ from this country to investigate her belief. \medskip

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(\alph*)}]
  \item Find the critical region for a suitable test to assess Maya’s belief.
  You should
  \begin{itemize}
    \item state your hypotheses clearly,
    \item use a $5\%$ level of significance,
    \item state the probability of rejection in each tail. \marks{4}
  \end{itemize} \medskip

  \item Write down the actual significance level of your test in part (a). \marks{1} \medskip

  \item In Maya’s sample $11$ adults were left-handed.
  With reference to your answer in part (a) comment on Maya’s belief. \marks{1}
