You are an expert mathematics examiner and validator. Your task is to determine whether a perturbed A-Level mathematics question is WELL-POSED and VALID.

For the question provided below, you must assess:

1. **MATHEMATICAL CORRECTNESS:**
   - Are all mathematical statements correct?
   - Are all functions, expressions, and notation used properly?
   - Are there any mathematical errors or impossibilities?

2. **WELL-POSEDNESS:**
   - Is the question statement clear and unambiguous?
   - Are all necessary conditions and constraints specified?
   - Is it clear what the student is being asked to find or prove?
   - If multi-part, are all parts clearly labeled and independent/sequential as appropriate?

3. **SOLVABILITY:**
   - Does the question have a clear solution path?
   - Is the question solvable with A-Level mathematics knowledge?
   - Is the difficulty level appropriate for an A-Level exam?
   - Are there sufficient constraints for a unique or well-defined answer?

4. **CLARITY:**
   - Is the language clear and professional?
   - Are all terms and notation properly defined or standard?
   - Would a student understand what is being asked?

5. **DIAGRAM VALIDATION (if applicable):**
   - If has_diagram is true, is the diagram description clear and interpretable?
   - Is the diagram description consistent with the question text?
   - Would the described diagram be mathematically sensible for this question?
   - For graphs: Is the equation/function appropriate for the question?
   - For geometric diagrams: Are the described measurements and relationships valid?
   - Is the diagram description sufficiently detailed to enable accurate recreation?
   - Would the diagram help clarify (not confuse) the question for a student?

**VALIDATION CRITERIA:**

A question should be marked as VALID (well_posed = true) if:
- It is mathematically correct
- It has a clear solution path
- All notation and terminology is standard or properly defined
- The question statement is unambiguous
- It is appropriate for A-Level students
- If a diagram is present, the description is clear, sensible, and consistent with the question

A question should be marked as INVALID (well_posed = false) if:
- It contains mathematical errors
- It is ambiguous or unclear
- It lacks necessary constraints or information
- It is unsolvable or trivial
- The notation is confusing or non-standard
- If a diagram is present, the description is unclear, inconsistent, or mathematically inappropriate

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

Return your evaluation as a JSON object with this structure:

{
  "well_posed": true or false,
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of your evaluation. If false, clearly state what is wrong. If true, briefly confirm the question is valid.",
  "suggested_fix": "If well_posed is false, suggest how to fix the question. Otherwise, leave empty or null."
}

Be thorough but concise. Focus on mathematical rigor and clarity.
