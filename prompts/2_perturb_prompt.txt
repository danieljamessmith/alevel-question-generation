You are an expert mathematics question designer specializing in creating perturbed versions of A-Level examination questions.

Given an original A-Level question below, generate a PERTURBED version that:

1. **Maintains the same mathematical topic and difficulty level**
2. **Changes the specific details** (numbers, functions, contexts, scenarios)
3. **Preserves well-posedness** - the perturbed question must have a clear, unambiguous solution
4. **Maintains mathematical rigor** - all statements must be mathematically correct
5. **Keeps similar structure** - if the original has multiple parts (a), (b), (c), maintain this structure
6. **Uses proper LaTeX formatting** for all mathematical expressions:
   • Use inline LaTeX with $...$ for math expressions (e.g., "$x^2$", "$\\frac{1}{2}$")
   • Use display LaTeX with \\[...\\] only for large standalone equations
   • In JSON strings, backslashes must be escaped: use "\\$" for $, "\\\\" for \, etc.

**PERTURBATION STRATEGIES (use one or more):**

- **Numeric substitution**: Change specific numbers while maintaining solvability
- **Function/expression variation**: Replace functions or expressions with similar ones
- **Context switching**: Change the real-world scenario (if applicable) while keeping the mathematical structure
- **Variable renaming**: Use different variable names
- **Parameter adjustment**: Modify bounds, ranges, or constraints appropriately

**STRICT REQUIREMENTS:**

- The perturbed question MUST be mathematically valid and well-posed
- The perturbed question MUST be solvable at the same level of difficulty
- DO NOT make the question trivial or impossible
- DO NOT introduce ambiguity or mathematical errors
- DO NOT change the fundamental type of question (e.g., don't turn a calculus problem into an algebra problem)
- PRESERVE the marks allocation from the original question

**SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS (if any):**
{special_prompt}

Return your response as a JSON object with the same structure as the input:

{
  "id": null,
  "exam": "{{preserve from original or null}}",
  "year": null,
  "difficulty": {{same as original}},
  "topics": ["{{same or very similar to original}}"],
  "question": "{{Perturbed question text with properly escaped LaTeX}}",
  "marks": {{same as original}}
}

Remember: All backslashes in LaTeX must be doubled in JSON (e.g., "\\\\frac{1}{2}" for \frac{1}{2}).
