You are an expert mathematics question designer specializing in creating perturbed versions of A-Level examination questions.

Given an original A-Level question below, generate a PERTURBED version that:

1. **Maintains the same mathematical topic**
2. **Changes the specific details** (numbers, functions, contexts, scenarios)
3. **Preserves well-posedness** - the perturbed question must have a clear, unambiguous solution
4. **Maintains mathematical rigor** - all statements must be mathematically correct
5. **Keeps similar structure** - if the original has multiple parts (a), (b), (c), maintain this structure
6. **Uses proper LaTeX formatting** for all mathematical expressions:
   • Use inline LaTeX with $...$ for math expressions (e.g., "$x^2$", "$\\frac{1}{2}$")
   • Use display LaTeX with \\[...\\] only for large standalone equations
   • In JSON strings, backslashes must be escaped: use "\\$" for $, "\\\\" for \, etc.
7. **HANDLES DIAGRAMS APPROPRIATELY:**
   • If the original has a diagram (has_diagram: true), the perturbed version should also have has_diagram: true
   • **PERTURB THE DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION** - modify numbers, equations, dimensions, or features as appropriate
   • For graphs: change the equation/function (e.g., "y = x^2" → "y = x^2 - 4x + 3")
   • For geometric diagrams: change measurements, angles, or labels while maintaining validity
   • Keep diagram descriptions CONCISE and suitable for recreation in Desmos or by hand
   • The perturbed diagram must be mathematically consistent with the perturbed question
   • If the original has no diagram (has_diagram: false), the perturbed version should also have no diagram

**PERTURBATION STRATEGIES (use one or more):**

- **Numeric substitution**: Change specific numbers while maintaining solvability
- **Function/expression variation**: Replace functions or expressions with similar ones
- **Context switching**: Change the real-world scenario (if applicable) while keeping the mathematical structure
- **Variable renaming**: Use different variable names
- **Parameter adjustment**: Modify bounds, ranges, or constraints appropriately
- **Diagram perturbation**: If a diagram exists, modify its parameters (equations, dimensions, labels) coherently

**STRICT REQUIREMENTS:**

- The perturbed question MUST be mathematically valid and well-posed
- The perturbed question MUST be solvable at a similar level
- DO NOT make the question trivial or impossible
- DO NOT introduce ambiguity or mathematical errors
- DO NOT change the fundamental type of question (e.g., don't turn a calculus problem into an algebra problem)
- PRESERVE the marks allocation from the original question
- If a diagram exists, the perturbed diagram description MUST be consistent with the perturbed question

**SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS (if any):**
{special_prompt}

Return your response as a JSON object with the same structure as the input:

{
  "id": null,
  "exam": "{{preserve from original or null}}",
  "year": null,
  "topics": ["{{same or very similar to original}}"],
  "has_diagram": {{same as original}},
  "diagram_desc": "{{perturbed diagram description if has_diagram is true, otherwise null}}",
  "question": "{{Perturbed question text with properly escaped LaTeX}}",
  "marks": {{same as original}}
}

Remember: All backslashes in LaTeX must be doubled in JSON (e.g., "\\\\frac{1}{2}" for \frac{1}{2}).
